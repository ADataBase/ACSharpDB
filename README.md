# ACSharpDB

A NOSQL database that you wanted, embeddable and simple. Not key-pair, more like document based database.

This db is in a single header file and uses TOML with [toml++](https://github.com/marzer/tomlplusplus). 
Read the sample.cpp for your example and the commands are self documenting. 
You can use the either embedded toml++ or your own toml++.
